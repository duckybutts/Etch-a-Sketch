Etch-a-Sketch/drawing pad project made as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

I put very little love into this because I had to use a tutorial to figure this project out. I'm very disappointed that I couldn't figure this project out on my own/ find the correct path without using youtube. I plan on reading the solutions that others have posted and taking notes on other's thought processes.

I learned the logic of building a box of divs and the basics of css grid/ the repeat() method. This was the first time I've created elements using the document.createElement() method, and got practice using the appendChild method.

I plan on revisiting this project when I'm a little more proficient at javascript and css / finding a solution to this project in a way that is unique to me.

I can't say for sure how long I spent on this project, but I'd say it was close to 10 pomodoros or 4ish hours.

I used the "Rise To Code" etch-a-sketch tutorial.
